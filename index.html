<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Rebecca, I live in East Los Angeles. I currently work at a Call Center. My goal is to earn a degree in Computer Science so I can provide for my family. I have no previous html experience and the first project was a bit challenging for me. After completing the assignment, however, I realized I really enjoyed creating the page. I'm sure this class will continue to bring new challenges but I look forward to solving the puzzles.</p>
<h3>When I have free time </h3>
<ol>
<li> I like to collect and build lego sets</li>
<li> Skate down the beach or bike path </li>
<li> Attend comedy shows </li></ol>

<p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/">DeviantArt</a> because you can find a community of mulitple art styles. </p></section>
